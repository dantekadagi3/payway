# 🎉 21 Days of Flutter - A Journey Begins! 🚀

Welcome to my **21 Days of Flutter** app! 🌟

After diving into the basics of Dart and Flutter, I decided to celebrate my 21-day milestone by building this simple, fun app. Flutter has been an exciting journey so far, and this app is a reflection of all the foundational knowledge I've gained during this time.

## 🚀 What Does This App Do?

- 🧑‍💻 Understanding the basics of **Dart**
- 🛠 Exploring **Flutter widgets**
- 🖼 Playing with **UI design and layouts**
- 🔄 Setting up **navigation** and basic interactivity

## ✨ Features:
- **Smooth navigation** between pages 📱
- **Interactive buttons** that trigger cool actions 🎯
- **Eye-catching UI** with fun colors and layout experiments 🎨
